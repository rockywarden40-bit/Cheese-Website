## Overview

**Cheese** is an all-in-one, desktop-focused chess study platform that runs entirely in the browser. It brings together everything you need to improve your game in one calm, cohesive workspace — analyse your games with a world-class engine, study openings, browse the greatest games ever played, and sharpen your skills against Stockfish.

There is no account to create and no server to configure. Cheese is a fast, fully client-side application: open it and start studying.

## Design Philosophy

Cheese is built to be a **calm, distraction-free environment for studying chess**. The interface stays quiet and out of the way so the board and your analysis remain the focus, while a modern, consistent look keeps the whole experience cohesive from page to page. The goal is simple: a study platform that feels focused, polished, and pleasant to spend time in.
